***Attempting to add authentication for firebase / React Native
   -Doing so with RNSInfo
   -Website is giving this suggestion: 
          Android it is implemented through FingerprintManager + Keystore . Keystore has a function called setUserAuthenticationRequired which makes Keystore requires user authentication before getting value.

          Because

          Jailbroken/Rooted devices can access your iOS' Keychain and Android's shared preferences in plain text, 
          so it is necessary to add another layer of protection.
